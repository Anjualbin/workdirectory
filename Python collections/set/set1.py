# set - used to store collection of elemens
# willnot allow duplicate elements
# doesnt keep an order(Will not store the elements in same order that we have given)
# can store diffrent types of data in a set(that means set is heterogenius)
# set is a mutable data collection
#  nesting(set inside anoter set) not posssible

set1={1,23,2,4,5,6,7,89,45,2,1,5}
print(set1)
print(type(set1))

# {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 45, 23, 89}
# <class 'set'>

print(set1)

# {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 45, 23, 89} will not change order once it is stored
